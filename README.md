# The Plant Plant

This repo is dedicated to the seminar "The Plant Plant - A Sensing Space of Green Control" at Bauhaus-University Weimar, WS 2024/25.

It contains information around the technical aspects of the seminar, namely regarding DIY electronics, DIY sensor technologies, microcontrollers and programming.

## Preparations

Before we are diving deeper into the world of DIY Electronics and programming, we need to collect and get familiar with our set of tools. Your first exercise is to download our go-to code editor (*Visual Studio Code*) and a plugin for programming microcontrollers (*Platform I/O*).

- download and install the software [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- get familiar with the interface --> [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJlVYggR1Y)
- install the Platform I/O (PIO) extension and check out the interface --> [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYSy_PLjytQ)
- check out what is a microcontroller --> [video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/adding-electronics-to-rapid-prototypes/what-is-a-microcontroller-ixvF0?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_EMEA__coursera_FTCOF_career-academy_pmax-multiple-audiences-country-multi&campaignid=20858198824&adgroupid=&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=x&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=&hide_mobile_promo&gad_source=2&gclid=Cj0KCQjw99e4BhDiARIsAISE7P_s_pTyHS_niVnGHkCF8gyC_9ml_EXtmRzS5yz2NkcuhRP1rhmoQG8aAhpoEALw_wcB)
- check out the ESP32 Dev Kit. This is the microcontroller we will be using throughout the seminar (we do not use Arduino this time) --> [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CB4t9sukM&t=18s)

If you do not understand all the content of the videos yet, it's totally fine. We will touch on that again during our workshop.

--> please bring your laptop and a usb-c cable to our next meeting / workshop.
