# Sensor Actuator Systems

Now it's time to go one step further and connect what we learned about sensors with what we learned about actuators to create our first sensor-actuator system!

# Getting Started

In order to do so, you should first recreate the basic circuit for the DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor as well as the basic circuit for the servo motor. You can find a summary of both in the respective folders on this repository. 

Once you have both circuits set up again and you made sure that everything is connected the right way, we can combine both codes in order to make the sensor (DHT22) and the actuator (Servo) work at the same time.
