# Controlling Servo Motors with ESP32

Regular DC motors spin endlessly without knowing how far they went. A servo motor is a motor with a built-in feedback mechanism (a sensor). As soon as the motor spins, it produces information about how much it spinned until this moment. 

In turn, this means that we can tell the motor exactly how far it should spin and when (or where) it should stop. In this tutorial, we are focusing on the SG90 miniature servo motor that is low-cost, easy to use and therefore often found in DIY projects. This particular servo motor is a positional model. Unlike a continuesly spinning motor, it is able to spin between 0 and 180 degrees and hold any location in between.

## Connecting SG90 to ESP32

Lets connect the motor to our ESP32 microcontroller! The motor has 3 leads:
- Brown / left = GND --> ground, connect to GND pin of ESP32
- Red / middle = VCC --> power, connect to 5V pin of ESP32 
- Orange / right = SIG --> singal, connect to GPIO 26 or any other PWM pin (marked with a wavy line)

*Please Note: if you are using any larger servo motor than this miniature version, you need to connect an external power supply. If you are using a regular DC or stepper motor, you need additional motor drivers. This is important â€“ you can easily damage the ESP32 microcontroller by pulling too much current from its 5V pin.*

## Basic Servo Programming

Once you connected the servo motor to your ESP32 microcontroller, you can plug it into your computer and start coding!

### Preparations

- open VScode and create a new project in platform I/O (as usual)
- click on the PIO icon (alien head), then click on "libraries"
- search for the "servo ESP32" library `important: Version 1.0.3` by Jaroslav Paral and add it to your project
- check the example code --> this is a port of the original arduino servo library, it is very easy to use! Be aware: all other versions apart from 1.0.3 are buggy.

### The Code

- click on "src" and your main.cpp file
- copy and paste the code from the "ESP32-servo-basic" folder of this repository
- compile and then upload the code to your ESP32 board
- Hurray: if everything went fine, your servo should be turning from one end to the other and back!

Step by Step:

`#include <Servo.h>`
--> includes the servo library we just added to our project

`#define SERVO_PIN 26`
--> assigns GPIO pin number 26 to the variable "SERVO_PIN"

`Servo myServo;`
--> creates an instance of the Servo class

`  myServo.attach(SERVO_PIN);`
--> in setup: defines GPIO pin number 26 / "SERVO_PIN" to be the servo control pin

`myServo.write(0);`
--> in loop: drives the servo to a certain position between 0 and 180 degree
